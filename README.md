# TWEB_Project_GitHub

This project is done for our TWEB class. We show people with not that much followers;
if they work, showing their "stats", as number of coded lines, number of repositories
and number of commits. We also show all their commits to check if they have good commits.

## How to run it locally

To run it locally, you have to fork the project, open a command line (bash or others) of your project and write this:
```
node httpServer.js
```
Then open a command of node.js and write the next line:
```
http-server "C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\PATH_TO_PROJECT" -c-1
```

After this, you will have some IP Adress written in your node.js command, you just need to choose one of them to run it locally on your browser.
